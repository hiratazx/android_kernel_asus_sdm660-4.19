AerithUniverse 4.19.x Kernel Source
Big Thanks to @RyuujiX, @SonicBSV, and the others
Based on KnightWalker 4.19 Kernel Source
==================================================

Getting Started
---------------
You can use this source if u Want or Download Builded Kernel / Release build from this https://telegra.ph/Projekt-Walker-419-Kernel-Download-Links-09-25 ,

Clone with `--recursive` option coz this source has submodule.

Just Copy, Paste, Then Execute the command :)


OverClock Kernel
------------------
This Kernel is using Stock Freq. If u want Overclocked Freq, Do this:

To Overclock CPU:

- Add `overclock.cpu=1` into boot cmdline. Or
- Hardcode, set this to 1 https://github.com/hiratazx/android_kernel_asus_sdm660-4.19/blob/test/drivers/clk/qcom/clk-cpu-osm-660.c#L263

To Overclock GPU:

- Add `overclock.gpu=1` into boot cmdline. Or
- Hardcode, set this to 1 https://github.com/hiratazx/android_kernel_asus_sdm660-4.19/blob/test/drivers/gpu/msm/adreno.c#L31

KernelSU
--------
KernelSU is implemented and enabled by default. If u don't want it, Do this:

- Add `kernelsu.enabled=0` into boot cmdline, or
- Disable `CONFIG_KSU`

If u only want to enable Safe Mode (U should enable KernelSU too), Which u just want Root Access and Modules Feature disabled, Do this:

- Add `kernelsu.safemode=1` into boot cmdline. Or
- Set `CONFIG_KSU_SAFE_MODE=y` in defconfig.

Using New Novatek Touchscreen Driver
------------------------------------
This source is still using original driver from 4.4 source... but, i have updated nvt driver.

Working smoothly on mine with new driver.

If u want to use new driver, do this:

- Add `use_new_nvtouch=1` into boot cmdline. Or
- Hardcode, set this to 1 https://github.com/hiratazx/android_kernel_asus_sdm660-4.19/blob/test/init/main.c#L147
- Or, Disable Original NVT Driver in defconfig. `CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NT36xxx_ASUS` is New NVT Driver.

Spectrum Support
----------------
Pick Spectrum Script from Here: https://github.com/RyuujiX/spectrum , then rename it to init.spectrum.rc

Name: 4.19-xxxxxxxxx

Note: 4.19-xxxx-oc is for Overclocked Both CPU and GPU.

Or , make it by ur self .
